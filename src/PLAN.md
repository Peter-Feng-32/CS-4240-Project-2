The Plan for Creating this Project:

1. Read the Tiger-IR code into a list of instructions.
2. Implement a translator that generates a list of MIPS32 instructions that operate on unlimited virtual registers.
3. Generate a CFG from the MIPS32 Instructions (with more than one instruction per basic block).
4. Implement a Naive Register Allocator
5. Implement a Intra-Block Register Allocator
6. Provide a run.sh script
7. Analyze performance
8. Write Design Document
9. Test with unused Tiger-IR/MIPS instructions.
